See all stock statuses on a per-variation level in the admin dashboard Products list.

== Description ==

If you're frustrated by having to constantly click around into variable products to see all your variations' stock statuses, and would like an at-a-glance overview of the stock levels of all your products, *including variations*, right on the Products page in the admin dashboard, this plugin is for you.

The stock overview is colour-coded so you can easily skim the page. You'll be able to quickly see what's in stock (green), what's low in stock (yellow), and what's out of stock (red) -- across all the variations of your variable products (and normal products too).

There is no settings page for this plugin as it currently is not configurable at all -- it just works right out of the box.

== Products Page Columns ==

To get the most out of this plugin, you'll want to make sure the new stock columns have enough space to be easily visible. If your admin dashboard Products list is becoming cluttered with too many columns, you can easily choose to hide a few columns by clicking the Screen Options dropdown on the top right, unticking some columns, and clicking Apply.

== Code ==
This plugin is completely open-source and free to use.
