# woo-variation-stock
A WordPress plugin for WooCommerce users.

**See stock info on a per-variation level in the admin dashboard Products list.**

If your admin dashboard Products list is becoming cluttered with too many columns, you can easily show/hide columns by clicking the Screen Options dropdown on the top right, unticking some columns, and clicking Apply.

There is no settings page for this plugin as it currently is not configurable at all.

# Roadmap
- [ ] Check if WooCommerce plugin is installed and activated so as not to crash on sites without WooCommerce
- [ ] Allow you to configure the "Low stock" threshold
- [ ] Make columns sortable and replace 'Filter by Stock Status' with a working filter on the new stock statuses (low stock, in stock, out of stock)
